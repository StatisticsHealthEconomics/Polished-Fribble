There are two apps in the link once you logon using your UCL ID/password:

- euler number
- pi number

All of you are member of both groups:

- shinyroom
- shinyroom_adm

only members of 'shinyroom_adm' group can view 'pi number' app.

There are extra users that you can use:

- sruser01
- sruser02
- sruser03
- sradmin01

all of above are member of 'shinyroom' groups but only the last one is a member of 'shinyroom_adm' .

They have the same password:

Bo@k3rey$

Which group can use which app is arranged behind the scene using Shinyproxy configuration.

The part that you are involving in is developing apps which can take additional parameters to tell its that 1.) who is the login user and 2.) which groups are the user belonging by part using the code:

shinyproxy_username <- Sys.getenv("SHINYPROXY_USERNAME", unset="")
shinyproxy_usergroups <- Sys.getenv("SHINYPROXY_USERGROUPS", unset="")

See examples as attachment.

When developing code locally, you can imitate that particular user/groups they are using the app, for examples:

source('sradmin01-euler.R')
source('sradmin01-pi.R')
source('sruser01-euler.R')

Hope that it gives some ideas of how Shinyproxy works.

Uploading your code to Egon to make them run within Shinyproxy is not as straight forward as doing Shiny app as your previously did. In the mean time if your code mature to some extents please send me, then I will upload it to you. There are parts that require manually touch and configure.

I gathered IT related information for Room Booking project here:

https://hub.stats.ucl.ac.uk/redmine/projects/room-booking/wiki

It requires your UCL ID/password and is only accessible inside college network or under VPN.

Nathan: I just implemented a quicker way to upload the code:
1. Push your code to repository as normal.
2. Click on the below link it will download the code to server and to virtual machine's image.

3. Resume your testing.
